### Review of 'Real World Machine Learning'

* useful , alive examples of NYC taxis, movie reviews and ads (NYC taxis seemed most engaging)
* Part 1 may seem a bit too observatory (you won't remember all the details anyway), Part 2 example chapters give much more value 
* book is a valueable experience, though in 2019 you are probably looking for building a NNfrom ground up for a real problem, so that knowledge 
  could sink in. The book overviews a lot - and this may be valuable - but if so, it should be less verbose to focus on the picture
* writing style is a bit too disengaged, personal examples and stories with less terminology would actually be more productive for the reader
