The five advantages of
machine learning are

  Accurate— ML uses data to discover the optimal decision-making engine for your problem. As
  you collect more data, the accuracy can increase automatically.

  Automated— As answers are validated or discarded, the ML model can learn new patterns
  automatically. This allows users to embed ML directly into an automated workflow.

  Fast— ML can generate answers in a matter of milliseconds as new data streams in, allowing
  systems to react in real time.

  Customizable— Many data-driven problems can be addressed with machine learning. ML
  models are custom built from your own data, and can be configured to optimize whatever metric
  drives your business.
  
  Scalable— As your business grows, ML easily scales to handle increased data rates. Some ML
  algorithms can scale to handle large amounts of data on many machines in the cloud.

The ML workflow has five main components: data preparation, model
building, evaluation, optimization, and predictions on new data.

In any problem domain, specific knowledge goes into deciding the data to collect, and this valuable
domain knowledge can also be used to extract value from the collected data, in effect adding to the
features of the model before model building. We call this process feature engineering

Machine-learning algorithms are distinguished from rule-based systems in that they create their
own models based on data. Supervised ML systems generalize by learning from the features of
examples with known results.

Machine learning is often more accurate, automated, fast, customizable, and scalable than
manually constructed rule-based systems.

Machine-learning challenges include identifying and formulating problems to which ML can be
applied, acquiring and transforming data to make it usable, finding the right algorithms for the
problem, feature engineering, and overfitting.

The basic machine-learning workflow consists of data preparation, model building, model
evaluation, optimization, and predictions on new data.

Online learning models continually relearn by using the results of their predictions to update
themselves.
