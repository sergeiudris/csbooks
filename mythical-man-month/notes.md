Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned
among many workers with no communication. This is true of reaping wheat or picking cotton; it is not even approximately true of systems programming.

p 19

Since software construction is inherently s systems effort - an exercise in complex interrelationships - communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning.
Adding more men then lengthens, not shorten, the schedule.

For some yeasr I have been successfully using the following rule of thumb
for scheduling a software task:

1/3 planning
1/6 coding
1/4 component test and early system test
1/4 system test, all components in hand

Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed from one mind,
or from a very small number of agreeing resonant minds.
