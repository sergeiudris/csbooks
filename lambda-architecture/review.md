* inspiring book, giving a glimpse of what challenges lie in big-data systems in real world
* and yet, a docker-based runnig solution (against some sample dataset) would make the book even more valuable and reference-able
* don't get me wrong, just getting the idea of lambda architecture and reasons and challenges is invaluable
