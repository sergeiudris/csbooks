    These are the metrics we’ll support:

    - Pageview counts by URL sliced by time—Example queries are “What are the
    pageviews for each day over the past year?” and “How many pageviews have
    there been in the past 12 hours?”
    
    - Unique visitors by URL sliced by time—Example queries are “How many unique
    people visited this domain in 2010?” and “How many unique people visited this
    domain each hour for the past three days?”
    
    - Bounce-rate analysis—“What percentage of people visit the page without visiting
    any other pages on this website?”
