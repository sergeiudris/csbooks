# Review of the book 'Professional Clojure' (2016 edition)

### pluses, gains, takeways

* practical and valuable pieces of code (4th and especially 6th chapter)
    - e.g. dev.clj from chapter 6 shows use of recursion to initialze db (in the style of Little Schemer)
    - really useful and elegant database fucntions in ch6, e.g. create-user and create-task
    - no water, applicable pieces of advice 


### possible improvements
    
* a better approach would be to build one complete working solution, that incorporates all the aspects (app, webapp, datomic, testing, performance) isntead of several projects

* using docker would drastically improve the appeal and possibilitises of the system - containerization is no long a option, it's an essential need


### conclusion

* definately worth going through if you are struggling to build systems, esspecially if you projects deamnds and time constraints made you cut certain corners and you want to get unstuck from cutting corners and get out from under the avalanche of feature requirements, inhibiting your engineering growth
