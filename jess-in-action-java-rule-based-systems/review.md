## Review of 'Jess in action: java rule based systems'


    Reading the book in 2019 is still relevant. At first it might seem , after the evolution of software engineering, steep rise
    container paltforms (docker) , of GUI developemnt (reactive, somewhat declrative) and cloud revolution in general, 
    technolgies used in the book are legacy. Moreover, after creation of Clojure, the Jess might look like being too specific.

    But it would tell the sstory at all. If you think about it: the book is a complete working story of engineering a still relevant soltuions.
    Not only examples still work, they are more interstion and practical than the majority of web guides and tutrials, always ending on hello world. Even clojure books show you hove to setup a hello-world type systems, that never have any value. 
    Jess in Action is a complete story:
        - explains rule systems and engines, giving real wordld exampels (no hypotheticals)
        - presents and exaplains innerworkings of a brilliant Jess-language
        - uncovers (with exmples) in detail how to collect knowledge for a rule system
        - walks step-by-step through amaizng real-world complete expert sytem soltuions: Tax Form Advisor, PC Repair Assistant,HVAC Controller,TekMart, where every next system is incrementally more fucntional and challenging, reinvoking your 'wow' 
        - provides an irreplacable insight and experience points in engineering

    It's fascinating, that books like JEss in Action are not considered one of the first must-reads. Relational programming is something you
    are looking for, but never know the term, wasting life buried in useless enterprise 'we need a button' swamp. 
    
    It's books like Jess in Action that fuel your growth and provide invaluable engineering  knowledge.
